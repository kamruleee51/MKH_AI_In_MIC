abstract: "Surgical tool detection, segmentation, and 3D pose estimation are crucial components in Computer-Assisted Laparoscopy (CAL).
The existing frameworks have two main limitations. First, they do not integrate all three components. 
Integration is critical; for instance, one should not attempt computing pose if detection is negative. 
Second, they have highly specific requirements, such as the availability of a CAD model.
